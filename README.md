Description:
This project implements a data lake solution using Apache Hadoop for storage and Apache Spark for data processing. It ingests, stores, and analyzes large datasets, and demonstrates batch processing and interactive querying.
 
Features:
 
Data ingestion and storage
Batch processing with Spark
Interactive querying with Hive
Data partitioning and indexing
Security and access control
 
Tech Stack:
 
Apache Hadoop
Apache Spark
HDFS
PySpark/Scala
Hive
Yarn
 
Setup Instructions:
 
Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-lake-hadoop-spark.gitcd data-lake-hadoop-spark
Set up a Hadoop cluster (single-node or multi-node).
Install and configure Apache Spark and Hive.
Ingest sample data into HDFS.
hdfs dfs -put local/path/to/data /hdfs/path/to/data
Run Spark jobs for batch processing.
```bash
spark-submit --class your.spark.job.MainClass path/to/
 
SAI APP
Certainly! Continuing from where we left off:
 
Plain Text
spark-submit --class your.spark.job.MainClass path/to/your-spark-job.jar
Copy
 
Use Hive to create tables and run interactive queries.
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE your_table_name (
    column1 STRING,    column2 INT,
    ...
)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION '/hdfs/path/to/data';
SELECT * FROM your_table_name;
 
 
Usage:
 
Customize the data ingestion, storage, and processing configurations as per your requirements.
Use Spark for batch processing and Hive for interactive querying.
Monitor and manage the Hadoop cluster and Spark jobs through their respective UIs.
